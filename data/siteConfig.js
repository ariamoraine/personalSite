  authorDescription: `Developer, passionate about what I do. After spending years in the culinary industry as a pastry chef, with programming as a
  hobby. I realized my passion for coding was more than just a side
  project. After dedicating myself and completing the Grace Hopper program at Fullstack Academy (a program with a less than 10% acceptance rate). I excitedly became a fullstack developer. Finding positions
  where I can practice my problem solving and continue to work on exciting projects. I currently work with <strong>Javascript, React, and mobX.</strong>`,
